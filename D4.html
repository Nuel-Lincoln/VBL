If the food is a solid, it has to be converted into liquid form before it is being sucked into the gut. Example of organisms which are fluid feeder are housefly, adult mosquito and butterfly.

They then feed on dead and decayed organic matter from which they derive their food e.g. Rhizopus, mushroom and mucor. They have the following features:

A parasite is a small organism that live in or on another large organism called host from which the parasite obtain food without contributing anything in return during which the host is harmed. Example of animal parasite are tick, lice, mite, fleas which are called ecto-parasites while tape worm, round worm, guinea worm are example of endo-parasite.
