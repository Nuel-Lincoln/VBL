It has a mouth that leads to a buccal cavity and the pharynx or throat. Food particles are sucked in by the pharynx's pumping activity as they go through the pharynx and into the small intestine. Three branches make up the small intestine, with one going to the head and the other two going to the tail. Numerous side branches sprout from the branches. Planaria digest intracellularly. All areas of the body may digest food thanks to the branching gut. Food that hasn't been digested is ejected from the mouth.

Birds uses their beak to pick fruits, grains etc because they don‚Äôt have teeth. The food then moves from the mouth through the oesophagus to the crop. The food is stored temporarily in the crop where it is moistened and fermented by various bacteria. From the crop, the food passes to the proventriculus where digestive enzymes such as pepsin and amylase are secreted on the food. From the proventriculus, the food moves to the gizzard where the it is grinded. The gizzard is also called the grindular stomach and it grinds the food with the aid of secreted acids. From gizzard, the food moves to the duodenum and intestine where further digestion and absorption of food takes place. The undigested food are moved through the caeca to the rectum and finally to the anus (cloaca) where the faeces and urine are removed from the body at the same time

The mouth contains the teeth, salivary gland and tongue. The teeth is used to cut, grind or chew food into tiny particles. The tongue rolls the food in bolus, help in food movement in the mouth, allows mixing of food with saliva or ptyalin and aids in swallowing of food into the gullet or oesophagus. The salivary gland in the other hand secretes saliva which is made up of useful enzymes known as ptyalin. The enzyme (ptyalin) breaks down starch into maltose which later swallowed into the gullet in forms of bolus. This allows swallowing of food in the mouth for swallowing and it also serves as solvent for the food. Saliva is alkaline in nature.
