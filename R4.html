This organism does not have a specialized organ to do the process of respiration. So, in amoeba respiration takes place through its cell membrane also called plasma membrane. Amoeba gets oxygen gas dissolved in surrounding water through its plasma membrane by the process of diffusion. The oxygen gas diffused inside the body is used up by amoeba. In the body the oxygen gas absorbed is used to break down the complex food material into simple molecules. During these metabolic reactions in the body of amoeba the oxygen gas is converted into carbon dioxide gas. The carbon dioxide gas is also liberated in the surrounding water through the same process of diffusion.

The insects as seen in the VBI have tiny openings in their abdomen called spiracles through which oxygen diffuses out. The spiracles lead into certain tubes called tracheae. These tracheae further divide into smaller tubes called tracheoles and these tiny tubes gets into the tissues and cells through the body fluid. Insects such as cockroach, grasshopper etc. use the tracheal system. The insects perform breathing movements by compressing its dorso-ventrally (i.e., inwards from both sides along its entire body) and then relaxes it. These processes allow the exchange of oxygen in insects.

At tadpole stage, the animal developed an external gill through which direct diffusion of gases takes place between the animal that is the tadpole and the respiratory medium which is the water. Oxygen dissolved in water can easily diffuse into the body and carbon dioxide can also easily diffused out of the body by simple diffusion. This is made possible because the ratio of body surface to volume is very large. In the next tadpole stage, the external gills disappear and internal gills developed under operculum or spout.  In this stage, the tadpole breaths in a manner similar to that of fish.

Respiration in plant is the process by which green plants make use of carbon dioxide and water in the presence of sun light to manufacture food. The process is otherwise known as photosynthesis. Photosynthesis is the opposite of respiration (in animals). The process of respiration in plants involves the use of the stomata and the lenticels by the plant to trap carbon dioxide and water for the manufacturing of food. The process is also known as the building up mechanism.

                                                                                                                                                                Plants do not have specialized organs used for gaseous exchange. However, gases move in and out of the plants through the stomata and lenticels.
                                                                                                                                                                Stomata: stomata are very thin opening found in the epidermis of leaves and stem of seedlings.
                                                                                                                                                                Lenticels: are breathing pores or tiny opening found in older stems.
